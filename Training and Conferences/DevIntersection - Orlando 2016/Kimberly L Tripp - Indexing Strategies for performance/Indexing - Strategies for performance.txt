Hey there SQLintersection attendees - Thanks so much for attending our sessions. We've posted our team's demo scripts on our own website just in case we need to update / tweak them.

You can find all of the resources here:
https://www.sqlskills.com/sql-server-resources/sql-server-demos/

Everything is stored by conference event and session.

And, if you can't find anything from the SQLintersection conference - feel free to email me directly!

Thanks so much for your attendance and we hope to see you next year!

Cheers,
Kimberly
